# Project Overview
Archaeological dental calculus serves as a valuable source of ancient DNA, offering insights into the oral microbiome, diet, and health of ancient populations. However, ensuring results are reproducible and robust is a must. The project for this repository systematically compares multiple DNA extraction and library preparation protocols to determine their effectiveness in recovering endogenous ancient DNA.

The study focuses on:

- Evaluating DNA yield and quality across protocols.
- Assessing the level of contamination and microbial diversity.
- Comparing the efficiency of library preparation methods for ancient samples.

## Installation and Dependencies
To reproduce the analyses and run the scripts in this repository, you will need the following software and packages:

### Required Software
QIIME 2: For microbiome analysis and taxonomic classification.

R: For statistical analyses and visualization.

##### R packages 
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "phyloseq", "vegan", "reshape2"))

## Key Results
1. DNA Yield: DNA varies according to wet lab protocol. 
2. Endogenous Content: Preservation state of sample and wet lab protocol employed impacts aDNA recovery.
3. Microbial Diversity: Differences in microbial profiles across protocols for poorly preserved samples, not for well-preserved samples.
